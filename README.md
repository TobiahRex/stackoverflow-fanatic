# Stack Overflow Fanatic [![endorse](http://api.coderwall.com/modocache/endorsecount.png)](http://coderwall.com/modocache)

A simple shellscript which registers a launchd process to
open a series of Stack Exchange sites every 24 hours.
This makes it only a matter of time before unlocking the
following badges:

- Enthusiast: Visited the site each day for 30 consecutive days
- Fanatic: Visited the site each day for 100 consecutive days

### Usage

    $ git clone git@github.com:modocache/stackoverflow-fanatic.git
    $ ./stackoverflow-fanatic/install.sh

### Uninstall the launchd process

    $ launchctl remove ~/Library/LaunchAgents/stackoverflowfanatic.modocache.github.plist
